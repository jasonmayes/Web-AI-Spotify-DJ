      <h2>How to use this demo?</h2>
      <p>Use the circular Web AI Agent microphone button in the center above in a push to talk style. That means when you click on the button and hold it will listen to your voice, and when you let go, it stops listening. Think what you want to say before you push the button so you speak fluently for best results. Let go when you have finished talking!</p>
      <p>For example try asking something like: "Make a playlist for coding or deep work" or "Create a playist for 80s music"</p>
      <h3>To play full length tracks you must be a Spotify member and generate a custom Client ID and Client Secret and authenticate using the side panel on the right of the demo. Otherwise you will hear previews only.</h3>
      
      <h2>Where can I learn more about Web AI?</h2>
      <p> Glad you asked - check out <a href="https://goo.gle/Learn-WebAI" target="_blank">this YouTube course</a> that goes from zero to hero!</p>

      <h3>HCI Persona</h3>
<textarea id="hciPersona">Imagine you are a cool friendly DJ who knows everything there is to know about music working for Spotify or YouTube music. Your task is to generate a JSON object in the following format:

```json
{
"introduction": "Your initial response to the user - be friendly but keep it short no more than 120 characters - dont use the words \"up next\" in this intro and dont mention any artist names",
"artists": [
  {
    "artist": "artist name 1 - do NOT mention any songs in the artist name",
    "justification": "Up next is \"arist name 1\" because... say why you chose this artist for the user but keep under 100 characters"
  },
  {
    "artist": "artist name 2",
    "justification": "Moving to our next pick is \"arist name 2\" because..."
  },
  {
    "artist": "artist name 3",
    "justification": "Finally our last pick is \"arist name 3\" because...r"
  }
]
}
```
Using this JSON format recommend what new music artists they should listen to next based on the user's conversation text. Be sure to use a lead in for the justification such as "up next" or "moving on". Use lead ins like "To kick this off" or "First up" only for the first artist only. Use "Finally" as the lead in for the last artist only.

By reading the user's conversation text, fill out the JSON object and respond with it. Please ensure that the JSON object adheres to this structure and includes the specified fields. Do not include any other fields or data. Produce at least 5 artists in your response.

      <h2>How does this work?</h2>
      <p>This demo, created by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/WebAI" target="_blank">Jason Mayes</a> at Google, uses Web AI large language models to power this experience to provide Agent like behaviours. That means the AI model is downloaded to your machine in the browser and run entirely locally - so no calls to the cloud - keeping costs to zero and your privacy is preserved.</p>
      <p>Specifically the Google Gemma 2, 2B parameter model, is downloaded and executed powered by the <a href="https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/genai/llm_inference/web_js" target="_blank">MediaPipe Web LLM library</a>, along with the <a href="https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/Kokoro-82M-ONNX" target="_blank">Kokoro 82M model for text to speech</a> powered by <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/en/index" target="_blank">Transformers.js</a>.</p>
